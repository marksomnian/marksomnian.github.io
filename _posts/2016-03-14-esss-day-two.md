**The BMI situation is not improving.** Going to Pizza Hut for all-you-can-eat was definitely not a good idea for the weight-conscious. But apart from that, interesting day.

The early part of the day was spent mostly with poster presentations. This is where judges, teachers and other students walk around the show floor and look at everyone's posters, talk about their project, ask questions. The most interesting thing is the comments from the judges and teachers, they are really out to help you improve your project and, more importantly, your ideas in the future.

Although I didn't get into the finals, where the best projects will be presented on stage tomorrow, I still walked away with some interesting idea for next year's project. (By the way, next year the symposium will be in Luxembourg 1.)

The afternoon was spent at the European Parliament and the Parliamentarium (visitors' centre). Not much to say there.

And now I'm sitting in a hotel room on a laptop writing this post. See you tomorrow!
