First casualty, my hair. I'd had a shower late the night before, but I hadn't had the scientific brainpower to brush it. Talk about a bad hair day. I looked like I had antlers, or elven ears, or whatever. Thankfully it evened out during the day, which was good.

Second casualty, my poster. I hadn't thought this one through. How would you transport an 80x70 cm behemoth in a suitcase? Well, **Natural Scientist** Marks Polakovs had the brilliant idea to just fold it up. #NOPE. Let's just say it's seen better days.

Third casualty, my French. At the ESSS opening ceremony, there was a very interesting presentation on gravitational waves. **In French.** Let's just say I would have been interested if it hadn't been in French.

Fourth casualty, my BMI. In the evening after the ceremony, the entire ESSS crew went to the Cite Dragon restaurant. Holy cow that place is massive. So massive it has its own sodding underground car park. And it was all you can eat. Did I mention I ate all I could eat?

And here we are. In a hotel room, at 22:30 PM, preparing for tomorrow and writing a blog post. Tomorrow's going to be a big day.
