title: Facebook's "Trending" system is the perfect example of why democracy doesn't always work.
---
(earlier the title said “democracy is bad,” but I changed it to avoid hypocrisy, as you will see.)


What is trending? “Trending shows you topics that have recently become popular on Facebook.” Basically, when  posts or (nearly always) images about a particular topic get liked, commented and shared a lot, Facebook decides through the power of statistics that the topic is popular now and shows it to even more people, in an effort to get more likes, but not why you think. It's not to get the original people more likes, it's for ad targeting.


May I remind you that, no matter how much philanthropy they get into, Facebook is still a for-profit corporation with investors to answer to. Facebook has to explain to their investors how literally every penny that they spend is going to help them make more money.


And Facebook's main business model is advertising. Facebook has SO much data about us all that they can't resist using it to give us all adverts based on what we like. Remember that one like in the first paragraph? That too goes into a huge database, the “social graph,” and is used to assume that you, well, like something and it's worth advertising it to you.


But I digress. How does it show how democracy doesn't always work? Well, as TotalBiscuit so eloquently put it, “Trending is a system that elevates the loudest and the stupidest to the top.” The way Facebook measures if something is “trending” is based on total engagement, that is to say, the number of likes, comments and shares. Why do you think Facebook were discussing the concept of reactions beyond just a like? Simple: more engagement numbers.


Have you ever noticed that the most common things you see in your news feed are images that appeal to the lowest common denominator (oddly enough, often proliferated by Lebanese radio stations) and say something crudely funny or familiar to elicit the most basic form of response on Facebook, the like? That's where the “stupid” comes into play.


The same is true in politics. Why do you think Donald J. Trumpson has a nonzero number of voters? Because he says something loud and something stupid. People who religiously don't come anywhere near the line (like most Democrat candidates) get a lot of votes spread out across their demographics, but the loudest and the stupidest get the most attention. “All publicity is good publicity.” They may completely alienate some, heck, they completely alienate *LOTS*, but that's just collateral damage in their crusade for attention.


The Lebanese radio stations know this too. If it wasn't for the aforementioned principle, the concept of internet virality wouldnty exist. People share stuff all the time, and stuff that elicits the strongest response gets shared and talked about the most. **Goddamnit, human nature. Why, oh why?**
