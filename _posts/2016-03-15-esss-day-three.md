**I have to hand it to these people, they really know how to do a science.** The first part of the day was spent by the six best junior and <del>six</del>**NINE** best senior projects presenting on stage, and, minus a few technical glitches (which seem to have been commonplace), they went well. Although they may not be the best public speakers, and there may have been a language barrier, the projects themselves were very interesting. A standout was two second year girls from Culham showing that people, even children, don't always prefer high sugar foods.

The afternoon was spent at Mini-Europe, and... Not very special things, as my school's director would say, but it was still very entertaining, just for all the wrong reasons. In the evening there was a party back at BXL1 HQ, again not much to say there.

And, for the last time, I'm in a hotel room on my laptop writing this blog post and getting ready for tomorrow. I'll have to wake up at siWHAT THE F*CK? Breakfast at SIX THIRTY IN THE MORNING? Are you joking?

Tomorrow is going to be all the funs.
