## Open source is not that hard, guise!

So, as you probably didn't know, I've recently been participating in the Google Code-In contest. In case you didn't know, it's a contest for 13-17 year olds where they participate in open source software development. The contest will close in a few weeks _(sorry!)_, but there's still time to talk about it. A task I just completed was for the [Fossasia](https://codein.withgoogle.com/organizations/fossasia/) organisation. It was to get my name, bio and face on their [contest website](http://gci15.fossasia.org/). It's not actually that hard. The thing I found the most tedious was all the things I had to do to Git, the version control system. It's a very powerful system, but with great power comes great responsibility and the things I had to do, well, let's just say, the word rhymes with _"duckery"_. But the mentors were really nice and persisted throughout the [ordeal](https://github.com/fossasia/gci15.fossasia.org/pull/553) and my face is now online. Mad props!
