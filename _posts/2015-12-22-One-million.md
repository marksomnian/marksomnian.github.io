One million.


As I write this, it was announced that one million refugees have entered Europe. One million. One million is a really huge number. It might not seem like a lot, but it really is.


One million is about the population of Luxembourg. Just imagine - a country the size of Luxembourg. Full of people who have experienced something terrible, something that made them take all their things and leave. To go on a journey of uncertainty, uncertain of whether they will start a new life or whether they will rot in detention camps, whether they'd get in to a country, whether they'd survive, whether their families would make it or whether they would have to lose everything they know.


Think about somebody you like, somebody you admire, somebody you know well. Think about your boyfriend or girlfriend, your secret crush, your childhood sweetheart, your group of friends, or just your best friend with whom you share everything, who you love more than anything in the world. Think about them. Picture them. Now think about your grand plans to go to uni, get married, have three children and spend the rest of your lives together. And now you wake up tomorrow morning and a friend tells you that in the middle of the night they were arrested for no crime, taken to a secret prison, tortured, beaten, forced to sign confessions, not going out to the light of day for the rest of their lives. Think about being torn from them, not being able to ever see them again.


Think about it. Now picture yourself going through that again. And again and again and again. And ten times over, hundreds, thousands, one million times over. This is what the countries that you hear about in the news every day are going through. You hear about people getting killed and politicians discussing their plans to stop this chaos but getting nowhere because some asshole can't think about all these lives being figuratively and literally torn apart. But you don't hear about that. All you see is a number. One hundred killed in a battle. A city of a thousand besieged. One hundred thousand people breaking down a border fence. One million people leaving behind everything they've ever known and starting a journey that they may never finish.


And then you get people like Donald Trump, like David Cameron, like the leaders of European countries, countries “united in diversity" but locking their borders, not showing any fucking human dignity, sitting in their fucking ivory towers looking down at these “swarms” of broken hearts, these destroyed souls. And I've never sworn on this blog before, but I'm struggling to find words strong enough to express just how fucking pissed off I am at these people who think they're better than us just because they exploited a flaw in a voting system to get themselves a nice office and some bragging rights. And I have one last thing to say to these people: **fuck you, you slimy narcissistic self-important egotistical inhuman morally bankrupt pieces of shit.**


Think about that.
