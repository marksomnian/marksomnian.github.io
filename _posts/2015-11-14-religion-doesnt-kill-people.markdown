<small>full disclosure. I do not believe in any god or other supernatural power (apart from the Flying Spaghetti Monster),
however in this post I will try to understand things from both points of view.</small>

I'm certain that _all_ of you know about the terroristic nonsense that rocked Paris yesterday (as I write this). It was
tragic. So many people lost their lives. But why? Why did these monsters decide to kill so many innocents?

People (especially <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuZ-VxhZrCA?t=1m57s">Fox News viewers</a>) will be quick to point the finger.
Islam. The religion that hates the western world and wishes to destroy it. **sigh**.

![Definition of religion](http://puu.sh/llbJg/4358ba8f27.png)

Have a look at the definition of religion in the image above. Notice anything? `the belief in` for example?
Religion is a system of beliefs that people choose to believe in of their own accord (barring them being forced
by somebody, because that's a different matter entirely'). Now, this won't be a blog post destroying religion, that will
be another time, but let's take this rationally.

I'm sure you, the reader, will agree with me that anyone who decides that killing over a hundred people is a great
idea is a psychopath. The human mind is an incredibly complex instrument that we do not fully understand, and the smallest
things can have a gigantic effect and vice versa. You can't just go on a whim and say that religion caused
this guy to kill all these people. In fact, chances are that this happened over a long period of time, and something recently
was just the straw that broke the camel's back. It could be that their membership of some of these terrorist groups
was a way for them to vent and channel their innate anger. Some of them may well believe that killing all westerners
is a way to get what they want, but that's their personal beliefs.

And what if these attackers shouted "`Allahu akhbar`" (`God is great` in arabic) as they did their dirty work?
I am not a psychologist, and so I cannot answer completely, scientifically or in any other serious manner, but
hear me out here.

Harken back to the title of this post. "Religion doesn't kill people, people kill people." These people may well believe
in their religion and think that it is justifying them killing people, but the way I see it, it's the other way round.
These people are (for one reason or another) mentally broken, insane, unstable and incapable of thinking rationally. Somehow,
somewhere, their mind recognises this. It tries to find an out, some way to justify their actions. It could be that
it is doing this exactly because it recognises that it is unstable, and is desperately trying to cling on to some fabric
of reality. **Religion is not the cause of this madness, these people themselves are.**
